Version field (short notes)
The IPv4 title field is a 4-bit field indicating the version used for the Internet protocol. For IPv4, this field is always installed at 4 (binary: 0100). Key points:
Size: 4 bits
Objective: identifies the IP version (IPV4)
Meaning: Always 4 for IPV4 packages
Location: The first field of the IPV4 title
This field guarantees that the reception system
Correctly interprets the package in accordance with the IPV4 protocol.

Header Length (IHL) Notes
The Internet Header Field (IHL) of an IPv4 header is a 4-bit field that specifies the length of the IPv4 header in 32-bit words.

Key Points:
Size: 4 bits
Purpose: Defines the length of the IPv4 header
Value range: 5-15 (each unit = 4 bytes)
Minimum header size: 20 bytes (5 x 4 bytes)
Maximum header size: 60 bytes (15 x 4 bytes)
Location: Second field in IPv4 header.

IPv4 Title Format - Version Field (Short Notes)
The IPv4 title field is a 4-bit field indicating the version used for the Internet protocol. For IPv4, this field is always installed at 4 (binary: 0100). Key Points:
Size: 4 bits
Purpose: Identify the IP version (IPv4)
Meaning: Always 4 for IPv4 packages
Location: First Field in IPv4 Title
This field ensures that the receiving device correctly interprets the package according to the IPv4 protocol.



IPv4 title format - Total length (short notes)
The Total IPv4 Title Length field is a 16-bit field, and is shown as the actual size of the IPv4 package that contains both the title and data.

Key Points:
Size: 16 bits
Purpose: Determine the total size of IPv4 packages
Value range: 20 bytes (min) Maximum 65,535 bytes (max)
Included: IPv4 + Height Load Title (Data)
Location: 3rd field in title IPv4
This field ensures that the receiving system knows how many data it will be processed and where the next package will start.


The TOS type field in an IPv4 title is an 8-bit field used to indicate the priority and quality of service (QOS) for which the package is transferred.

Key Points:
Size: 8 bits
Purpose: Determine package priority and settings in processing
underground:
Priority (3 bits): Determine the level of priority (0-7)
Delay (1 bit): low (0) or high (1)
Pass capacity (1 bit): Normal (0) or High (1)
Reliability (1 bit): Normal (0) or High (1)
Reserved (2 bits): Unused (set to 0)
Latest Use: Replaced with Differentiated Services (DSCP) for the Best Classification of Traffic
This field helps you optimize network performance based on application requirements.




Flags (o, df, mf) short note
The flag field in the IPV4 title is a 3-bit field used to control packet fragmentation.

Key points:
Size: 3 bit
Purpose: Fragmentation management and re -assembly
Bits:
O (reserved bit): always installed on 0 (unused). df(don\'t fragment-1 bit):
0 → Packets can be fragmented.
1→Do not fragment the packet. MF (more fragments - 1 bit):
0 → The last fragment or not fragmentation.
1 → More fragments. These flags help you control large individual collected packages in your network.



Fragment Offset (Short Notes)
The fragment shift field in the IPv4 header is a 13-bit field indicating the location of the fragment in the original package.

Key Points:
Size: 13 bits
Purpose: Helps to reject fragmented packets in the correct order
Value range: 0 to 8191 (measured in 8-byte blocks)
When in use: Package is fragmented due to size limitations
Location: After the flag field in the IPv4 header
This field ensures that fragmented packets are properly reached at the destination.




Protocol (short notes)
The protocol field in the IPv4 header is an 8-bit field, indicating the type of transport layer protocol used in the package.

Key Points:
Size: 8 bits
Purpose: Identify the next level of protocol (for example, TCP, UDP, etc.)
General values ​​for the protocol:
1→ICMP (Message Protocol on the Internet)
6→TCP (Program Management Protocol)
17→UDP (User Datagram Protocol)
89→OSPF (open the quickest method first)
Location: 9th field in IPv4 title
This field ensures that the receiving system processes data with the correct protocols in the transport layer.




Introduction to IPv4 Header Format
The IPv4 (Internet Protocol version 4) header is a structured data format 
that carries essential information required for routing and delivering packets across 
networks. It is a fundamental component of the TCP/IP model and ensures proper communication between devices.



Key Features of IPv4 Header
Fixed minimum size: 20 bytes (can extend up to 60 bytes with options).
Carries essential control information, such as source and destination IP addresses, fragmentation details, and TTL (Time to Live).
Facilitates packet routing across networks by allowing efficient packet processing.
Ensures error checking through the header checksum field.
